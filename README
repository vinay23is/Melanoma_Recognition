# Melanoma Detection using CNN

## Project Overview
Melanoma is a deadly form of skin cancer, accounting for **75% of skin cancer-related deaths**. Early detection is crucial, and this project aims to build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify melanoma and other skin conditions using image data. This AI-powered approach can assist dermatologists in diagnosis, reducing manual effort.

## Project Pipeline
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Load and preprocess images  
   - Resize to **180Ã—180 pixels**, batch size **32**  
   
2. **Dataset Visualization**  
   - Display sample images from each class  
   
3. **Baseline Model Training**  
   - Build a CNN model  
   - Normalize pixel values **(0 to 1)**  
   - Train for **~20 epochs** and evaluate performance  
   
4. **Addressing Overfitting/Underfitting**  
   - Apply **data augmentation** and retrain the model  
   - Train for **~20 epochs** again and analyze improvements  
   
5. **Class Distribution Analysis**  
   - Identify class imbalances  
   
6. **Handling Class Imbalance**  
   - Use **Augmentor** to balance dataset  
   - Generate synthetic samples  
   
7. **Final Model Training**  
   - Train on the rectified dataset for **~30 epochs**  
   - Assess improvements in model performance
